# LRU Cache (Go)

A generic and lightweight implementation of an **LRU (Least Recently Used) cache** in Go, using Go generics (`Go 1.18+`).

## âœ¨ Features

- **Fast `O(1)` access and update** for LRU operations
- **Generic support**: any comparable key, any value
- **Simple APIs**: `Put`, `Get`, `Size`, `Delete`, `Reset`, `Shutdown`
- **Sharded Cache Implementation** for scalable key distribution with `GetMultiIter` support
- **Test coverage and mocks**: Comprehensive unit tests using `testify` and `mockery` generated mocks
- **Benchmarks included**: Ready-to-run performance tests for read-heavy and write-heavy scenarios

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Clone this repo and use `make` for common tasks:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mcphone2004/lru.git
cd lru
make build        # Build the project
make test         # Run unit tests
make lint         # Run golangci-lint
```

## ðŸš€ Benchmarks and Make Commands

This project includes benchmark tests to evaluate performance under different workloads:

- `BenchmarkReadHeavy` â€” measures concurrent read performance
- `BenchmarkWriteHeavy` â€” measures concurrent write performance

Run benchmarks using the provided `make` commands:

```bash
make bench         # Run all benchmarks
make bench-read    # Run only read-heavy benchmark
make bench-write   # Run only write-heavy benchmark
```

By default, benchmarks are defined in `lru/benchmark_test.go` and can be customized or extended.
